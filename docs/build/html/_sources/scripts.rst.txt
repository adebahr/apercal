Scripts
=======

The directory ``apercal/scripts`` contains scripts for running the pipeline and creating mosaics

Pipeline scripts
----------------

There two template scripts in  ``apercal/scripts/pipeline``. One script (``run_apercal_qa_apergest_happili-01.py`) can be used to run all steps of the triggered (automated) pipeline manually including ingesting of data. ``run_apercal_qa_happili-01.py`` can be used to other types of processing (and testing). Both scripts can be run on all happilis.

Mosaic scripts
--------------

The directory ``apercal/scripts/mosaic`` contains a python script to create continuum mosaics with some default settings.
